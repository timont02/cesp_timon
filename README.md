# TicTacToe

The programm "TicTacToe" is a computer game in RISC-V-Assembly language.<br>
The game can be played by one player (human against a bot) or two players (human against human). <br>
Both players can occupy on field per round. It is not allowed to occupy a field, which is already used. To win, one player must own three fields in a row, a collumn or a diagonal.<br>
